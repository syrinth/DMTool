He has been hired by the Azure-Hutton trading company to protect the ship while it is in port.

The two thugs are mopping the decks and will discourage the party.

The deck of the ship is uremarkable and like all other ships. There is a ladder climbing up high to the crows nest, a wheel by which the captain can steer and two doors, one leading below deck and another leading to the captain's quarters.

The door to the Captain's Quarters is locked.

It appears to be made of whatever was handy at the time, as it is a patchwork of cobbled together wood, stone and tarp.

A single torch barely burns in the stairway beside you, there is a table near the center of the room at which a small, wiry-looking man is sleeping. You notice that he carries a heavy mace, faint green flames seem to twirl and hiss off of it.

-To your right, there is a large, heavy stone door. Beyond the door, there is a foul stench.

-A small door is in to your left at the far end of the room, past the guard. After 1d6 rounds, another wererat will emerge from the room and wake up the first with a cold beer.

-Going forward, a series of tunnels appears to have been gnawed or dug out of the earth, shored up here and there as needed.

-End of the tunnels to the Processing Room is another simple wooden door. Hardness 5, hp 10, break 13. Door is unlocked.

The tunnels are patrolled by a thug who can be snuck past</_description><_encounters>Wererat|Thug (2 HD)|Wererat</_encounters><_loot>Longsword|+1 Heavy Mace|+1 Studded Leather|Cloak of Resistance|2d10 gold|Banded Mail|Shortsword|Studded Leather</_loot><_traps /><_relevantChecks>DC -1 Move Silently check to avoid waking the guard

Barrels and crates line the walls, at the far corner lies a table on which several powders lay, while the other wall has a large steaming vat of greenish-red water. There is a tiny man with a pointed face doing something complicated over the table. He appears to be distracted.

A door immediatey to the side is partly opened.

Note: Due to the smell of the processing, the Dire Rat requires a DC 20 Survival check to detect anyone.</_description><_encounters>Wererat|Dire Rat (6 HD)</_encounters><_loot>+1 Heavy Mace|Oasis Drug|+1 Studded Leather Armor|+1 Studded Leather Armor</_loot><_traps /><_relevantChecks>DC 20 Search check reveals alternate route to the back alley behind the Rat's Nest</_relevantChecks><_rooms>Basement|Store Room</_rooms></Room><Room><_name>Store Room</_name><_description>A small store room about ten by fifteen feet.
